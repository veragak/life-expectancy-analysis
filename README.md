# Life Expectancy Analysis Using PCA and Elastic Net

This project investigates international differences in life expectancy using 
global health, nutrition, demographic, and socioeconomic indicators.  
The analysis applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality 
reduction and **Elastic Net regression** for predictive modeling and variable 
selection.

The aim is to both **understand the main drivers of life expectancy** and 
**predict life expectancy for new countries** using optimized components.

This project was originally developed for the course  
**FEM11149 – Introduction to Data Science (Erasmus School of Economics)**, 
and has been reorganized into a clean, reproducible data-science workflow.
